abstract = {Cardinality estimation has a wide range of applications and is of particular importance in database systems. Various algorithms have been proposed in the past, and the HyperLogLog algorithm is one of them. In this paper, we present a series of improvements to this algorithm that reduce its memory requirements and significantly increase its accuracy for an important range of cardinalities. We have implemented our proposed algorithm for a system at Google and evaluated it empirically, comparing it to the original HyperLogLog algorithm. Like HyperLogLog, our improved algorithm parallelizes perfectly and computes the cardinality estimate in a single pass.},

@article{b801a9734ab04fae9930bc40ef10ed8c,
title = "A Learned Sketch for Subgraph Counting",
abstract = "Subgraph counting, as a fundamental problem in network analysis, is to count the number of subgraphs in a data graph that match a given query graph by either homomorphism or subgraph isomorphism. The importance of subgraph counting derives from the fact that it provides insights of a large graph, in particular a labeled graph, when a collection of query graphs with different sizes and labels are issued. The problem of counting is challenging. On one hand, exact counting by enumerating subgraphs is NP-hard. \% On the other hand, approximate counting by subgraph isomorphism can only support 3/5-node query graphs over unlabeled graphs. \% Another way for subgraph counting is to specify it as an \textbackslash{}SQL query and estimate the cardinality of the query in \textbackslash{}rdbm. Existing approaches for cardinality estimation can only support subgraph counting by homomorphism up to some extent, as it is difficult to deal with sampling failure when a query graph becomes large. A question that arises is if subgraph counting can be supported by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). The existing DL approach for subgraph isomorphism can only support small data graphs. The ML/DL approaches proposed in \textbackslash{}rdbm context for approximate query processing and cardinality estimation cannot be used, as subgraph counting is to do complex self-joins over one relation, whereas existing approaches focus on multiple relations. In this paper, we propose an Active Learned Sketch for Subgraph Counting (\textbackslash{}ALSS) with two main components: a sketch learned ({\L}SS) and an active learner (\textbackslash{}AL). The sketch is learned by a neural network regression model, and the active learner is to perform model updates based on new arrival test query graphs. \% We conduct extensive experimental studies to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of \textbackslash{}ALSS using large real labeled graphs. Moreover, we show that \textbackslash{}ALSS can assist query optimizers to find a better query plan for complex multi-way self-joins.",

abstract = {Sketches are single-pass small-space data summaries that can quickly estimate the cardinality of join queries. However, sketches are not directly applicable to join queries with dynamic filter conditions --- where arbitrary selection predicate(s) are applied --- since a sketch is limited to a fixed selection. While multiple sketches for various selections can be used in combination, they each incur individual storage and maintenance costs. Alternatively, exact sketches can be built during runtime for every selection. To make this process scale, a high-degree of parallelism --- available in hardware accelerators such as GPUs --- is required. Therefore, sketch usage for cardinality estimation in query optimization is limited. Following recent work that applies transformers to cardinality estimation, we design a novel learning-based method to approximate the sketch of any arbitrary selection, enabling sketches for join queries with filter conditions. We train a transformer on each table to estimate the sketch of any subset of the table, i.e., any arbitrary selection. Transformers achieve this by learning the joint distribution amongst table attributes, which is equivalent to a multidimensional sketch. Subsequently, transformers can approximate any sketch, enabling sketches for join cardinality estimation. In turn, estimating joins via approximate sketches allows tables to be modeled individually and thus scales linearly with the number of tables. We evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of approximate sketches on queries with selection predicates consisting of conjunctions of point and range conditions. Approximate sketches achieve similar accuracy to exact sketches with at least one order of magnitude less overhead.},

abstract = {Data preparation and data profiling comprise many both basic and complex tasks to analyze a dataset at hand and extract metadata, such as data distributions, key candidates, and functional dependencies. Among the most important types of metadata is the number of distinct values in a column, also known as the zeroth-frequency moment. Cardinality estimation itself has been an active research topic in the past decades due to its many applications. The aim of this paper is to review the literature of cardinality estimation and to present a detailed experimental study of twelve algorithms, scaling far beyond the original experiments.First, we outline and classify approaches to solve the problem of cardinality estimation - we describe their main idea, error-guarantees, advantages, and disadvantages. Our experimental survey then compares the performance all twelve cardinality estimation algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms' accuracy, runtime, and memory consumption using synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that different algorithms excel in different in categories, and we highlight their trade-offs.},

This algorithm has O(q) time complexity, where q is the number of values including duplicates, and produces an estimation with an arbitrary accuracy prespecified by the user using only a small amount of space. Traditionally, accurate counts of unique values were obtained by sorting, which has O(q log q) time complexity. Our technique, called linear counting, is based on hashing. We present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of linear counting. The analysis reveals an interesting result: A load factor (number of unique values/hash table size) much larger than 1.0 (e.g., 12) can be used for accurate estimation (e.g., 1\% of error). We present this technique with two important applications to database problems: namely, (1) obtaining the column cardinality (the number of unique values in a column of a relation) and (2) obtaining the join selectivity (the number of unique values in the join column resulting from an unconditional join divided by the number of unique join column values in the relation to he joined). These two parameters are important statistics that are used in relational query optimization and physical database design.},

The algorithms are based on statistical observations made on bits of hashed values of records. They are by construction totally insensitive to the replicative structure of elements in the file; they can be used in the context of distributed systems without any degradation of performances and prove especially useful in the context of data bases query optimisation.}
